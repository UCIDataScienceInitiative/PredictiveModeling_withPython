Now the labels represent exclusive class membership whereas before they represented physical quantities (baseball player's salary, for example).      \n",

    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat y_{i}$ is our model's prediction of label $y_{i} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and round() sends $\\hat y_{i}$ to 0 or 1, whichever is closer. Great.  Now all we have to do is perform gradient descent to train the model...wait a minute...$\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{class}}$ isn't differentiable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider another loss function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} -y_{i} \\log \\hat y_{i} - (1-y_{i}) \\log (1-\\hat y_{i})\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where, again, $\\hat y_{i}$ is our model's prediction of label $y_{i} \\in \\{0,1\\}$.  Here $\\log$ will refer to the natural logarithm, base $e$.  This is called the *cross-entropy* error function.  Notice it's well-suited for classification in that it is directly optimizing towards $0$ and $1$.  To see this, let $y_{i}=1$.  In that case, the second term is zero (due to the $1-y_{i}$ coefficient) and the loss becomes $\\mathcal{L}= - \\log \\hat y_{i}$.  Recall that $-\\log \\hat y_{i} = 0$ when $\\hat y_{i}=1$ and that $-\\log \\hat y_{i} = \\infty$ when $\\hat y_{i}=0$.  Thus, we are encouraging $\\hat y_{i}$ to become equal to $1$, its class label, and incurring penalty the more it moves towards $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced Note: Cross-entropy loss still may seem arbitrary to some readers.  It is derived by taking the negative logarithm of the Bernoulli distribution's density function, which has support {0,1}.  Therefore, we can think of each class label as the result of a Bernoulli trial--a parameterized coin flip, essentially.  Many loss functions are merely the negative logarithm of some probability density function.  Squared error is derived by taking the $-\\log$ of the Normal density funciton.\n",

    "Notice parameterizing $\\hat y_{i}$ with $\\mathbf{x}_i^T\\beta$ doesn't work since the value would be unconstrained and result in the loss being undefined if $\\hat y\\le 0$.  Thus, we need a function $f$ such that $f:\\mathbb{R} \\mapsto (0,1)$.  We can probably think-up many functions that have a range on this interval so we'll limit the functions we can use by specifying two more requirements: the function must *(1)* be differentiable (in order to perform gradient descent) and *(2)* have a probabilistic interpretation (to think of the output as the probability the input is in class 1).  \n",
