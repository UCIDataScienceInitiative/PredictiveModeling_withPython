    "In addition to arrays which can have any number of dimensions, Numpy also has a `matrix` data type which always has exactly 2.  **DO NOT USE `matrix`**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The original intention behind this data type was to make Numpy feel a bit more like Matlab, mainly by making the `*` operator perform matrix multiplication so you don't have to use `np.dot`.  But `matrix` isn't as well developed by the Numpy people as `array` is.  `matrix` is slower and using it will sometimes throw errors in other people's code because everyone expects you to use `array`."
